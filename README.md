# turbot_utils
This is a Python3 SDK for managing your [Turbot](https://turbot.com/) cluster

Current CircleCi build status:  [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/mosburn/turbot_utils/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/mosburn/turbot_utils/tree/0.1.0)

At the inception of this project Turbot had not yet released a Python API I have gone ahead and created an initial one so I did not have to constantly write REST commands into my scripts.

This is still a fledgling project that I am slowly working on as my needs require it at the office. If you find this useful please submit bug reports and/or merge requests to help this along.
